# Penpal – A Human Approach to Language Learning

## About the Project

I built **Penpal** to solve a problem I experienced firsthand as a language learner.

I'm currently at a conversational level in Spanish and, like millions of others, started my journey using popular language apps like **Duolingo** (which has over [100 million monthly users](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/duolingo-statistics/)). While fun and motivating, I realized apps like that weren’t helping me reach fluency — and I wasn’t alone. Many of my friends shared the same feeling: we could recall vocabulary and grammar, but we couldn’t *communicate* effectively. Whats useful in saying "Thats a fat dog" or "I have a watch" when your trying to meet native speakers in any language.

That changed when I started using **italki**, a fantastic app where you can pay tutors by the hour for one-on-one conversation practice. The results were immediate. Talking with real people — making mistakes, laughing, learning about their culture — was more powerful than any gamified app. It made one thing clear:

> **Fluency comes from connection.**

## Why Penpal

That experience inspired a question:  
> What if language learners could connect not just with tutors, but with *each other*?

What if beginners could practice with other beginners?  
What if advanced learners could connect with native speakers in a meaningful exchange — helping each other grow while learning about new cultures and building friendships?

That’s where **Penpal** comes in.

Penpal is a mobile app designed for iOS to connect language learners from around the world — not just to study vocabulary, but to *talk* with real people. It allows users to:

- Match with others based on language proficiency, learning goals, and interests  
- Exchange languages (e.g., Spanish learner ↔ English learner)  
- Send messages securely through a modern chat system  
- Practice in a human way — through **conversation**

_This app is both a personal passion project and a demonstration of my iOS development skills and daily ongoing of learning within Swift to be a better developer. My hope is to improve my skills and help people like myself along the way. This project showcases modern architectural patterns following an MVVM approach for scalability, Firebase integration, and a focus on creating meaningful user experiences._
